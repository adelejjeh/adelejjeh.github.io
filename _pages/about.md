Hi! I'm Adel Ejjeh, a PhD candidate at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in the Computer Science department. I am co-advised by [Prof. Sarita Adve](http://rsim.cs.illinois.edu/~sadve/) and [Prof. Rob Rutenbar](http://rutenbar.cs.illinois.edu/). I am also working closely with [Prof. Vikram Adve](http://vikram.cs.illinois.edu) and his group. My primary area of research is Computer Architecture and Compilers. 

Research Interest
------
I am interested in the emergence of FPGAs in heterogeneous systems, and as such how to make these devices easier to use for those without a hardware background. Specifically, we are looking at automating the process of generating efficient FPGA implementations from high-level languages, with minimal programmer hand-holding, using compiler transformations (we are working on this as part of the Heterogeneous Parallel Virtual Machine project described on Vikram's website). Also, another aspect which we are planning to look at is redesigning the FPGA memory-susbsystem abstractions to improve host-device interaction in heterogeneous systems with FPGAs.  

Academic Background
-----
I hold a Master of Engineering ('15) and a Bachelor of Engineering ('12), both in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the [American University of Beirut](www.aub.edu.lb). During my master's degree, I was advised by [Prof. Haitham Akkary](http://website.aub.edu.lb/fea/publicprofile/Pages/profile.aspx?MemberId=ha95#) and my thesis involved designing a latency-tolerant, speculative multithreading architecture and application programming interface and implementing a cycle-accurate performance simulator for it.  

Personal Background
-----
I come from a small country in the Middle East called [Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebanon). It is a very beautiful country, sitting on the east coast of the Mediterranean Sea. The capital city, Beirut, has always been known as a top tourist attraction. If you are in the area, you should definitely visit! I moved to the US in 2015 to pursue my PhD degree. My hobbies include playing the piano, reading, and playing video games.
